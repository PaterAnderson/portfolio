                <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
                <p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR: </strong>Below you will find an overview of the
                    legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the
                    provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of
                    residence or establishment. If, in individual cases, more specific legal bases are relevant, we will
                    inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contract fulfillment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b)
                            GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract to which the
                        affected person is a party or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the
                        request of the affected person.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - the processing
                        is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the responsible party or a third
                        party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and fundamental freedoms of the affected
                        person demanding the protection of personal data do not prevail.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection
                    regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This particularly
                    includes the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz â€“ BDSG) for the protection against
                    the misuse of personal data in data processing. The BDSG contains specific regulations regarding the
                    right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special
                    categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and data transmission as well as
                    automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling. Furthermore, state data
                    protection laws of the individual federal states may also apply.</p>

                <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
                <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements,
                    taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope,
                    circumstances, and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying probabilities of occurrence
                    and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of
                    protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
                <p>Measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by
                    controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the related access, input,
                    disclosure, safeguarding of availability, and separation of data. Furthermore, we have established
                    procedures that guarantee the exercise of rights of the affected persons, the deletion of data, and
                    reactions to data breaches. Additionally, we consider the protection of personal data already in the
                    development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures in accordance with the principle of
                    data protection through technology design and through privacy-friendly default settings.</p>
                <p>Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect user data
                    transmitted over our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology.
                    Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data
                    transmission on the Internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the
                    website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby protecting the data from
                    unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data
                    transmissions meet the highest security standards. When a website is secured with an SSL/TLS
                    certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator for
                    users that their data is transmitted securely and encrypted.</p>

                <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
                <p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal provisions as soon as the underlying
                    consents are revoked or no further legal grounds for processing exist. This applies in cases where
                    the original purpose of processing no longer applies or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to
                    this rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require longer storage or archiving of the
                    data.</p>
                <p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary
                    for legal prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons must be
                    appropriately archived.</p>
                <p>Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data,
                    specifically for certain processing activities.</p>
                <p>When there are multiple statements regarding the retention period or deletion deadlines of a date,
                    the longest period shall always apply.</p>
                <p>If a period does not explicitly begin on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it
                    automatically starts at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period
                    occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in which data is stored, the triggering
                    event for the period is the time when the termination or other end of the legal relationship takes
                    effect.</p>
                <p>Data that is no longer needed for the originally intended purpose but is stored due to legal
                    requirements or other reasons will only be processed for the reasons that justify its retention.</p>

                <h2 id="m10">Rights of the Data Subjects</h2>
                <p>Rights of data subjects under the GDPR: As data subjects, you have various rights under the GDPR,
                    which are particularly outlined in Articles 15 to 21 of the GDPR:</p>

                        to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data that is based on Article
                        6(1)(e) or (f) of the GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If your
                        personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any
                        time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such marketing; this also
                        applies to profiling, to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> You have the right to withdraw any consent you have
                        given at any time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Information:</strong> You have the right to request confirmation as to whether

                    <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You have the right to request the completion or
                        correction of your inaccurate data in accordance with legal provisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Deletion and Restriction of Processing:</strong> You have the right, in
                        accordance with legal provisions, to request that your data be immediately deleted or,
                        alternatively, to request the restriction of processing of your data in accordance with legal
                        provisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to receive the data concerning
                        you that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format,
                        or to request its transfer to another controller, in accordance with legal provisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority:</strong> Without prejudice to
                        any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a
                        supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of your habitual residence, your place
                        of work, or the location of the alleged infringement, if you believe that the processing of your
                        personal data violates the provisions of the GDPR.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="m42">Definitions</h2>
                <p>This section provides an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Where the terms are
                    legally defined, their legal definitions apply. The following explanations are primarily for the
                    purpose of understanding.</p>
                <ul class="glossary">
                    <li><strong>Master Data:</strong> Master data includes essential information necessary for
                        identifying and managing contractual partners, user accounts, profiles, and similar
                        associations. These data may include personal and demographic details such as names, contact
                        information (addresses, phone numbers, email addresses), birth dates, and specific identifiers
                        (user IDs). Master data forms the basis for any formal interaction between individuals and
                        services, institutions, or systems, enabling unique identification and communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Data:</strong> Content data includes information generated during the creation,
                        editing, and publishing of content of any kind. This category of data can include text, images,
                        videos, audio files, and other multimedia content published across various platforms and media.
                        Content data is not limited to the actual content but also includes metadata that provides
                        information about the content itself, such as tags, descriptions, author information, and
                        publication dates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact Data:</strong> Contact data refers to essential information that enables
                        communication with individuals or organizations. This includes, among other things, phone
                        numbers, postal addresses, and email addresses, as well as communication means such as social
                        media handles and instant messaging identifiers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meta-, Communication-, and Procedural Data:</strong> Meta-, communication-, and
                        procedural data are categories that include information about how data is processed,
                        transmitted, and managed. Metadata, also known as data about data, includes information that
                        describes the context, origin, and structure of other data. It may include details like file
                        size, creation date, author of a document, and revision histories. Communication data records
                        the exchange of information between users across various channels such as email traffic, call
                        logs, social network messages, and chat histories, including involved persons, timestamps, and
                        transmission paths. Procedural data describes processes and workflows within systems or
                        organizations, including workflow documentation, transaction logs, and audit logs used for
                        tracking and verifying activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Usage data refers to information capturing how users interact with

                        how users use applications, which features they prefer, how long they stay on certain pages, and
                        which paths they take through an application. Usage data can also include frequency of use,
                        activity timestamps, IP addresses, device information, and location data. It is particularly
                        valuable for analyzing user behavior, optimizing user experiences, personalizing content, and
                        improving products or services. Additionally, usage data plays a crucial role in identifying
                        trends, preferences, and potential issues within digital offerings.</li>
