                    which require the protection of personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Security measures</h2>
            <p>
                We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to
                the risk, in accordance with legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
                implementation, and the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of the processing, as well as the
                varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
                by controlling both physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, transmission,
                availability, and separation of the data.

            <h2>Transfer of personal data</h2>

                these data may include, for example, service providers entrusted with IT tasks or providers of services
                and content embedded in a website. In such cases, we comply with legal requirements and enter into
                contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data to protect your data.

                consents are revoked or no other legal basis for processing exists. This applies to cases where the
                original purpose of processing no longer exists, or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this
                rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require longer retention or archiving of the data.
